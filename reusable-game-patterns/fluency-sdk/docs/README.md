# Multiplication Fluency Generator

This directory contains documentation for the Multiplication Fluency Generator implementations.

## Overview

The Multiplication Fluency Generator is designed to help students practice and master multiplication facts through:
- Sequenced introduction of facts based on pedagogical ordering
- Spaced repetition for optimal learning
- Tracking of accuracy and speed
- Adaptive difficulty based on student performance

## Implementation Plans

We have three implementation plans of increasing complexity:

1. [Simple Implementation](./simple-implementation.md) - Basic functionality with linear progression
2. [Intermediate Implementation](./intermediate-implementation.md) - Adds spaced repetition and better tracking
3. [Advanced Implementation](./advanced-implementation.md) - Fully adaptive with ML-based scheduling and comprehensive analytics

## Common Interface

All implementations follow the same interface defined in [interface.md](./interface.md) to allow seamless swapping between implementations.

## Getting Started

For initial development, start with the Simple Implementation and gradually add features from the Intermediate and Advanced plans as needed.
